            <h1 class="main-title mt5 mb-5">C10k Problem</h1>

            <p class="description mt-5 mb-3">In the early 2000s, web applications were rapidly evolving in the web
                world, and the
                demand for dynamic web content was growing. Traditional web servers, like Apache, IIS, Lighttpd, and
                Jagsaw, were effective at serving static content, but they struggled to handle a large number of
                concurrent connections efficiently, especially for dynamic content generated by applications.The leading
                reason behind the development of NGINX was to address the <strong>"C10k problem"</strong> .
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-5">What is "C10k problem"</h3>
            <p class="description">
                The "C10k problem" is a term coined to describe the challenge of designing and implementing a web server
                that can handle a large number of concurrent connections, typically on the order of 10,000 connections
                or more. The term was first introduced in a 1999 paper titled, "The C10k Problem" by Dan Kegel.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Traditional web servers on 2000s, like Apache, are used multithread architecture.
                Their single
                thread should handle one connection at a time. That was the main reason failed to handle concurrent
                connections.That is the "C10k problem," which refers to the challenge of efficiently handling 10,000
                concurrent
                connections.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-5">What means "C10k"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>C:</strong> Stands for "concurrent," indicating that the challenge
                    is about handling a large number of connections simultaneously.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>10k: </strong> Represents the number 10,000 which is the
                    target level of concurrency the system should be able to manage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="sub-title mt-5">Problems to solving "C10k"</h3>

            <p class="description">Involves overcoming several technical hurdles for solving the c10k problem: </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>1. Network I/O:</strong> Efficiently managing network input and
                    output (I/O) is crucial. Non-blocking I/O and event loops enable a single thread to handle multiple
                    connections by efficiently switching between tasks when I/O operations are pending.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>2. Concurrency Model:</strong> Traditional web servers used
                    synchronous programming models, where each connection blocks the program's execution until
                    completed, which is not suitable for high concurrency. Modern web servers used Asynchronous
                    programming models and event-driven architectures accordingly
                    they can manage multiple connections efficiently.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>3. Resource Management:</strong> Managing system resources like
                    memory and CPU is critical to ensure that the system doesn't become overwhelmed under heavy load.
                    Efficient resource allocation and deallocation are essential.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>4. Scalability:</strong> The system should be designed to scale
                    horizontally by adding more servers or instances as the demand for connections grows. Load-balancing
                    techniques can distribute incoming connections across multiple servers.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>5. Connection Pooling:</strong> Reusing existing connections
                    through connection pooling reduces the overhead of establishing and closing connections for each
                    client.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>5. Caching:</strong> Caching method can achieve workload reduction
                    on the backend server, Caching frequently accessed data or results can significantly reduce the workload on the server and
                    it reduces latency of the web application to the user, as cached data can be served quickly without
                    extensive processing.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>5.Load Balancing:</strong> It is the main solution for the C10k problem 
                    load-balancing Distributing incoming connections across multiple server instances can help balance the load and prevent a single server from becoming a bottleneck.
                    it helps to prevent server crashes by a massive number of concurrent connection.</li>
                <br>

                <li class="description-a-tag"><strong>5.Hardware Upgrades:</strong> In some cases, upgrading hardware components like network interfaces, memory, and CPUs can help improve the system's ability to handle high concurrency.</li>
                <br>

            </ul>

            <p class="description">
                Solving the c10k problem requires a combination of  architectural considerations, programming techniques,and optimization strategies to create a system that can handle a massive number of concurrent connections without sacrificing performance and responsiveness.</p>
